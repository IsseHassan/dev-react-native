# Dev React Native

Welcome to my Dev React Native repository! This is a space where I share the projects I've built using React Native. The main focus of this repository is to demonstrate the capabilities of React Native and how it can be used to build diverse mobile applications.

Each project is housed in its own branch, allowing for isolated development and easy navigation. After completion, projects are merged into the main branch. Feel free to explore each branch to see the different projects.

## Repository Structure

- Main Branch: Contains general information and updates.
- Project Branches: Each project has its own branch. Navigate to the desired project to see its code and specific README.

## Projects

1. **Goal Input App**: This is the first project in this repository. It's a simple app that allows users to input their goals.

The list of projects will be updated as more projects are added. Check back often to see new projects!

## Contributing
